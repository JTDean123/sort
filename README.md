Sorting algorithm visualizer

I really like sorting algorithms.  Of course python has a built in sort() method, but using it is not as much fun as writing your own sorting algorithms.  

This script allows the user to visualize 400 random numbers being sorted via [bubble sort (O(n2))](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort), [selection sort (O(n2))](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort), and [merge sort (O(n(log(n)))](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort).

Visualizing these algorithms may help the user better understand how to sort data algorithmically.
